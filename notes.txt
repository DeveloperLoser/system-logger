Goal: Log/Obtain admin password/access

Plan A: Keylog UAC on printer update
UAC stops all non admin applications- allegedly

Plan B: Launch keylogger as admin via impersonating broken printer driver elevation prompt, tricking with pyinstaller, words VisualBasic Macros
Dude on stackoverflow was wrong, impossible

Plan C: Wait for lightspeed to update-Keylog admin password there (installer uses basic textbox for admin info, lul)
Waiting sucks

Plan D: Fake break lightspeed by just repeatedly killing the process(s)
Need elevated perms to terminate lightspeed apps, should have tested closing them manually first..............

Plan E: Make identical UAC prompt with TKInter
TKinter doesnt have a win 10 theme... And I hate UI code

Plan F: Take screenshot of UAC- overlay invisible buttons/boxes & launch with word VB macro
Cant take screenshot of UAC, recreate printer error on home PC? To lazy to make non admin account, cant lower UAC level to allow screenshot AND force input of username/password

Plan G: Task scheduler prompt upon running install for printer drivers, wait till download box appears then try to scdmng mmc.exe an elevated cmd prompt every day 7 AM & allow run on demand
schtasks from command line doesnt show an administrator prompt

Plan H: Plan B, but after being elevated, Plan G task is created
Tried it without testing, they started to enter info into the real but fake prompt but got spooked by it being unverified, logged into own account and fixed printer bug, fuck
VB Macro couldve been better, it was running on the old short timer so it opened itself before he clicked on it, that also spooked him

Plan I1: Fake installer/updater for something like Li-Clipse, Plan G without printer stuff
LiClipse install link is blocked by the filter, put it on a USB stick later?

Plan I2: Vexcode Pro installer needs admin, whatever printer stuff I was doing but that instead, ALSO, launch vexcode installer with the script, so that it doesnt ask for admin twice. Installer is verified, and this is not, buuuuuut maybeeee?


TODO:
Change the Trigger for the task
Make sure windows defender will only nuke it after its run, and make sure notifications are turned off to block it from displaying
Fix elevation prompt showing for real installer- Installer launches properly with admin, but prompt is still shown? #03 - Actually kinda interesting

Ideas:
Look at ways of recreating printer bug, looks like he changed the default printer or its IP
Theres a post-it with 2 username/password combos marked HS above back desk, get picture?
Lots of potential with schtasks, fake bugs, etc.
Password wasnt entered for lightspeed installer- but it(lightspeed apps) request one outside of UAC. Disassemble installer? Or is it just getting it over the net (wireshark)

Notes:
Plan I2 works on local, and to great effect. Needs to be bundled into one EXE to work, so that the elevated key is properly given to task and real_installer, and they are run elevated
Funny thing is, it works to well. Windows defender detects the exe as a virus and quarantines it, but AFTER it makes the task; side effect is that ID 15 is sent, and elevated prompt instantly opens
