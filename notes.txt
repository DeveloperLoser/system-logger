Goal: Log/Obtain admin password/access

Plan A: Keylog UAC on printer update
UAC stops all non admin applications- allegedly

Plan B: Launch keylogger as admin via impersonating broken printer driver UAC prompt, tricking with pyinstaller, words VisualBasic Macros
Dude on stackoverflow was wrong, impossible

Plan C: Wait for lightspeed to update-Keylog admin password there (installer uses basic textbox for admin info, lul)
Waiting sucks

Plan D: Fake break lightspeed by just repeatedly killing the process(s)
Need elevated perms to terminate lightspeed apps, should have tested closing them manually first..............

Plan E: Make identical UAC prompt with TKInter
TKinter doesnt have a win 10 theme... And I hate UI code

Plan F: Take screenshot of UAC- overlay invisible buttons/boxes & launch with word VB macro
Cant take screenshot of UAC, recreate printer error on home PC? To lazy to make non admin account, cant lower UAC level to allow screenshot AND force input of username/password

Plan G: Task scheduler prompt upon running install for printer drivers, wait till download box appears then try to scdmng mmc.exe an elevated cmd prompt every day 7 AM & allow run on demand
schtasks from command line doesnt show an administrator prompt

Plan H: Plan B, but after being elevated, Plan G task is created
Tried it without testing, they started to enter info into the real but fake prompt but got spooked by it being unverified, logged into own account and fixed printer bug, fuck
VB Macro couldve been better, it was running on the old short timer so it opened itself before he clicked on it, also spooked him

Plan I: Fake installer/updater for something like Li-Clipse, Plan G without printer stuff

TODO:

Ideas:
Look at ways of recreating printer bug, looks like he changed the default printer or its IP
Theres a post-it with 2 username/password combos marked HS above back desk, get picture?
Lots of potential with schtasks, fake bugs, etc.
